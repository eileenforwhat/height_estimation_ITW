# height_estimation_ITW


## Concerns
- do we need to annotate the base? if we don't 
- how do we use the prior for scaling in the existence of projective ambiguity? if the prior and the tall object are both on the same plane it shouldn't matter
- should we perform metric rectification on it? not for the 2 view geometry case. let's perform dumb scaling in all three directions for now.


## To Do: two-view reconstruction
- [ ] SIFT for keypoint detection & correspoondence - eileen
- [x] copy F computation from assignments - simon
- [ ] compute P, P' from F - simon


## To Do: SfM
- [ ] Item 1
- [ ] Item 2


## timeline
1. two view reconstruction on human body
2. collect photos of tall building
3. two view reconstruction on building
4. sfm on 
5. presentation (Thursday, December 7, 2023)
