# height_estimation_ITW


## Concerns
- do we need to annotate the base? if we don't 
- how do we use the prior for scaling in the existence of projective ambiguity? if the prior and the tall object are both on the same plane it shouldn't matter
- should we perform metric rectification on it? not for the 2 view geometry case. let's perform dumb scaling in all three directions for now.


## To Do: two-view reconstruction
- [ ] SIFT for keypoint detection & correspoondence - eileen
- [x] copy F computation from assignments - simon
- [ ] compute P, P' from F - simon


## To Do: SfM
- [ ] Item 1
- [ ] Item 2


## timeline

Work session (Monday 11/20)
1. two view reconstruction on human body, figure out the kinks
2. collect photos of tall building [cathedral of learning]
3. two view reconstruction on building, should be easy

Work session (Thursday 11/30)
4. multi-view sfm on tall building, need to implement

Work session (Saturday 12/2)
5. collect photos of mountain, ROAD TRIPPPPP
6. multi-view sfm on mountain

Work session (put together results week of presentation)
7. presentation (Thursday, December 7, 2023)
